- Experiment 1
  Build a mashup server which has some kind of api 
  a) to fetch multiple services 
  b) and then send them to the client
  c) Both (a) and (b) must be asynchronous utilizing nio.

- The challenge in writing non-blocking code seems to be the abstractions. Currently there is no way to find out if the entire ChannelGroup has been closed. 

- Open Issues in current impl (11/26/10):
  - Need ability to timeout after X ms. (Need to checkout the timout/timer implementations in netty)
  - Need to use Executors/Handlers to prevent the code from running in IO threads.

-> R1 --> 1) List services
      	  2) Setup operation on done
	  3) call services.
